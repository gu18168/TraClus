# TraClus Algorithm

This is an implementation of TraClus (TRAjectory CLUStering) [1] algorithm in Rust.

The original paper of this algorithm can be found at http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/pdf/sigmod07_jglee.pdf 
The authors of the paper implemented the algorithm in C++, so it could be helpful to develop one in Rust for 
other users to use.

# Note

The implementation only support **Two-dimensional** coordinate point.
